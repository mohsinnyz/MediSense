## Overview

**MediSense** is an AI-driven symptom checker and medical assistant web app built with Streamlit. It allows users to select symptoms and predicts the most probable disease using a trained machine learning model. The app also integrates with Google Gemini API (if an API key is provided) to provide concise, medically accurate information about the predicted disease, including next steps, home remedies, and urgent care advice.

---

## Features

- Select 3 to 5 symptoms from a comprehensive list.
- Predict disease based on symptoms using a pre-trained ML model.
- Displays prediction confidence.
- Provides detailed disease information using the Google Gemini API.
- Clean and responsive UI with custom styling.
- Informative disclaimers for medical advice.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/medi-sense.git
   cd medi-sense
````

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended)**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # Linux/macOS
   .\venv\Scripts\activate    # Windows
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up Streamlit secrets**

   Create a `secrets.toml` file in `.streamlit` directory with the following content to add your Gemini API key (optional):

   ```toml
   GEMINI_API_KEY = "your-google-gemini-api-key"
   ```

   If you don't have a Gemini API key, the app will still work but without detailed disease descriptions.

## Usage

Run the Streamlit app locally with:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

* Select 3 to 5 symptoms from the dropdown list.
* Click the **Predict Disease** button.
* View the predicted disease and confidence.
* If configured, read detailed disease info powered by Google Gemini API.
